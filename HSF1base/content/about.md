**Abstract:** HSF1 (heat shock factor 1) is an evolutionarily conserved master transcriptional regulator
of the heat shock response (HSR) in eukaryotic cells. In response to high temperatures, HSF1
upregulates genes encoding molecular chaperones, also called heat shock proteins, which assist
damaged intracellular proteins to be refolded or degraded. Accumulating evidence reveals however
that HSF1 is implicated in several other physiological and pathological processes such as
differentiation, immune response and multidrug resistance, as well as in aging, neurodegenerative
demise and cancer. To address how HSF1 participates in these processes one should systematically
analyse its target genes. Here we present a novel database called HSF1Base (hsf1base.org) that
contains a nearly comprehensive list of HSF1 target genes identified so far. The list was obtained by
manually curating publications on individual HSF1 targets and analysing relevant high throughput
transcriptomic and chromatin immunoprecipitation data derived from the literature and Yeastract
database. To support the biological relevance of HSF1 targets identified by high throughput
methods, we performed an enrichment analysis of (potential) HSF1 targets across different
tissues/cell types and organisms. We found that general HSF1 functions (i.e., targets are expressed
in all tissues/cell types) are mostly related to cellular proteostasis. Furthermore, HSF1 targets that
are conserved across various animal taxa operate mostly in cellular stress pathways (e.g.,
autophagy), chromatin remodelling, ribosome biogenesis and aging. Together, these data highlight
diverse roles for HSF1, expanding far beyond the HSR.
